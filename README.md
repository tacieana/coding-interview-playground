# Coding Interview Playground 🚀👩‍💻

Welcome to my **coding interview preparation playground**! 👩‍💻✨

This repository is where I solve and store algorithmic problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **HackerRank**, and the classic book **"Cracking the Coding Interview"**. The goal here is simple: sharpen my coding skills, explore data structures, and become a pro at technical interviews!

### 📚 Platforms and Sources:
- 🔗 [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- 🔥 [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
- 📖 **Cracking the Coding Interview** (by Gayle Laakmann McDowell)

### 📦 Project Structure (packages explained):

- `dataStructuresProblems/`
  - 📂 **`dataStructuresProblems\dataStructuresProblems`**
    - Root package, general structure for organizing the problems.

  - 📂 **`dataStructuresProblems\dataStructuresProblems\dataStructures`**
    - Implementations and notes about specific data structures.

  - 📂 **`dataStructuresProblems\hackerrank`**
    - Problems solved from the HackerRank platform.

  - 📂 **`dataStructuresProblems\dataStructuresProblems\leetcode`**
    - Problems from **LeetCode**, organized by data structure type. 
    
      In each LeetCode problem class, you'll find a comment with:

      - 📖 **The original problem description** (copied directly from LeetCode).
      - 🏆 How my solution **beats other submissions** in terms of runtime and memory usage (shown in percentage), exactly as LeetCode presents it.


  - 📂 **`dataStructuresProblems\dataStructuresProblems\hackerrank`**
    - Solutions and implementations for HackerRank challenges.

  - 📂 **`dataStructuresProblems\dataStructuresProblems\crackingCodeInterview`**
    - Solutions to problems from the famous book **"Cracking the Coding Interview"**.
